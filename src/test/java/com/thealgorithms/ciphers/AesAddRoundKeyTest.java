Scenario 1: Valid BigInteger inputs
Details:
  TestName: addRoundKeyWithValidValues
  Description: This test checks the addRoundKey method where valid ciphertext and key of type BigInteger are provided to the method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialise two BigInteger values, ciphertext and key.
  Act: Call the addRoundKey method with the ciphertext and key as parameters.
  Assert: Check whether the returned result is of BigInteger type.
Validation:
  The expected outcome of this test is a BigInteger value, which is the result of the XOR operation between ciphertext and key. This test's significance is primary as it validates the core functionality of the addRoundKey method.

Scenario 2: Null Input
Details:
  TestName: addRoundKeyWithNullValues
  Description: This test is designed to check the addRoundKey method's behavior when null values provided as method parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: The test does not require any setup because we will be calling the method with null values.
  Act: Call the addRoundKey method with ciphertext and key as null.
  Assert: Check whether the method throws a NullPointerException.
Validation:
  With null inputs, the addRoundKey should throw a NullPointerException since it doesn't handle null values. The test foregrounds the method's robustness in terms of input handling and error management.

Scenario 3: Zero Value Input
Details:
  TestName: addRoundKeyWithZeroValues
  Description: This test examines the addRoundKey method's response to zero values provided as method parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialise two BigIntegers as zero values.
  Act: Invoke the addRoundKey method with the two zero values as parameters.
  Assert: Ensure that the returned result is also zero.
Validation:
  The XOR operation between two zero values should yield zero. This test verifies the function's accuracy and consistency at basic mathematical operations.

Those are the main test scenarios that can be applied to the addRoundKey method. Other scenarios would be implicitly testing the BigInteger class itself, which is unnecessary because we expect it to operate correctly from the Java standard library.
