""" 
Scenario 1: Testing when ciphertext is "0"
  
Details:  
TestName: shiftRowsDecWithZeroCiphertext.
Description: This test is designed to check the functionality of the shiftRowsDec method when the ciphertext BigInteger input is "0".
Execution:
Arrange: The BigInteger "0" is set as ciphertext.
Act: The shiftRowsDec method is called with "0" as ciphertext. 
Assert: Assert that the returned BigInteger value is "0".
Validation: 
It is being validated that the method works as expected when given "0" as input. As there are no cells to shift in a "0" block, the result should also be "0". If the test passes, it indicates that the method can handle and return accurate results for a "0" ciphertext input.

Scenario 2: Testing with a valid ciphertext input 

Details:  
TestName: shiftRowsDecWithValidCiphertext.
Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the shiftRowsDec method when a valid ciphertext is provided.
Execution:
Arrange: A valid ciphertext BigInteger such as "1234567890abcdef" is set.
Act: The shiftRowsDec method is invoked with the prepared ciphertext.
Assert: Assert that the returned BigInteger value is as expected after shifting cells in the rows. The expected result can be calculated manually or by using known good code.
Validation: 
The assert aims to verify that the method correctly shifts the cells as per algorithm. If the test passes, it means the entity can accurately compute shiftRowsDec for valid ciphertext inputs.

Scenario 3: Testing with large ciphertext input

Details:  
TestName: shiftRowsDecWithLargeCiphertext.
Description: This test is designed to verify the shiftRowsDec method's functioning when given a large ciphertext.
Execution:
Arrange: A large ciphertext BigInteger is chosen (like the max value of BigInteger).
Act: The shiftRowsDec method is invoked with the large ciphertext.
Assert: Assert an expected BigInteger output, calculated manually or by using known good code.
Validation: 
The assert aims to verify that the method can correctly handle and return accurate results, even when provided with a large ciphertext. This test verifies the method's ability to handle extreme conditions and robustness. A successful test proves that the method can handle BigInteger inputs of all allowable sizes.
