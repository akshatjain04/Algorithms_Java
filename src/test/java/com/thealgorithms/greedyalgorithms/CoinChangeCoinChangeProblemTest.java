```
Scenario 1: Exact Change with Single Coin Type
Details:
  TestName: exactChangeWithSingleCoinType
  Description: Verify that the method returns a list with a single coin type that matches the amount exactly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define an amount that is exactly divisible by one of the coin denominations.
  Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with the defined amount.
  Assert: Check that the returned list contains the correct number of coins that sum up to the amount.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly calculates the minimum number of coins needed when the amount is divisible by one of the coin denominations without the need for other coin types. This test is significant as it checks the method's ability to provide an optimal solution with the least coin variety.
Scenario 2: Change with Multiple Coin Types
Details:
  TestName: changeWithMultipleCoinTypes
  Description: Ensure the method can handle amounts that require a combination of different coin denominations to reach the total.
Execution:
  Arrange: Specify an amount that is not divisible by a single coin denomination but can be made up using multiple types.
  Act: Call the coinChangeProblem method with the specified amount.
  Assert: Verify that the list returned contains the correct combination of coins that add up to the amount.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the method can effectively provide a list of coins in multiple denominations that together make up the specified amount. This test is crucial for assessing the method's ability to solve the problem with mixed coin types.
Scenario 3: Amount Less Than Smallest Coin Denomination
Details:
  TestName: amountLessThanSmallestCoinDenomination
  Description: Test the method's behavior when the amount is less than the smallest coin denomination available.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set an amount smaller than the smallest coin denomination (1 in this case).
  Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem with the small amount.
  Assert: Ensure the returned list is empty, as no coins can be given for an amount less than the smallest denomination.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the method handles cases where it is impossible to provide change, which is vital for preventing incorrect or impossible solutions.
Scenario 4: Amount Is Zero
Details:
  TestName: amountIsZero
  Description: Check how the method handles a scenario where the amount is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define an amount with a value of zero.
  Act: Execute the coinChangeProblem method with the zero amount.
  Assert: Assert that the returned list is empty since no coins are needed for a zero amount.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the method does not return any coins when the amount is zero, which is important for correctness in scenarios where no change is required.
Scenario 5: Large Amount Requiring Many Coins
Details:
  TestName: largeAmountRequiringManyCoins
  Description: Test the method's performance and correctness when dealing with a large amount that requires many coins.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a large amount that will need a significant number of coins in various denominations.
  Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with the large amount.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned list has the correct number of coins in each denomination that adds up to the large amount.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method can handle large amounts and still provide the correct change. This scenario tests the algorithm's scalability and accuracy with more extensive inputs.
Scenario 6: Negative Amount
Details:
  TestName: negativeAmount
  Description: Evaluate the method's response to a negative amount, which is an invalid input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Input a negative amount to the method.
  Act: Attempt to call the coinChangeProblem method with the negative amount.
  Assert: Expect an appropriate handling of the invalid input, such as throwing an IllegalArgumentException.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the method protects against invalid input and fails gracefully, maintaining the integrity of the application by not proceeding with an invalid operation.
Scenario 7: Non-Divisible Amount Greater Than Smallest Coin
Details:
  TestName: nonDivisibleAmountGreaterThanSmallestCoin
  Description: Confirm that the method can handle an amount that is not divisible by any coin denomination but is greater than the smallest coin.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose an amount that cannot be exactly divided by any single coin denomination.
  Act: Call the coinChangeProblem method with the chosen amount.
  Assert: Ensure the returned list provides the best possible combination of coins that sum up to the amount or the closest possible value without exceeding it.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the method can provide the closest possible change without exceeding the amount when an exact match is not possible. This test is key for real-world scenarios where exact change may not always be feasible.
