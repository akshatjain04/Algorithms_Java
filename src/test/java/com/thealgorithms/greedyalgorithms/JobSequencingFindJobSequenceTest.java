```
Scenario 1: Valid job sequence with all jobs fitting within the deadline
Details:
  TestName: jobSequenceWithAllJobsWithinDeadline
  Description: This test checks if the method correctly generates a job sequence where all jobs can be scheduled within their deadlines.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an ArrayList of jobs with deadlines that do not exceed the size and are all schedulable.
  Act: Invoke the findJobSequence method with the created list of jobs and size.
  Assert: Check if the result is a string that represents the correct sequence of job IDs.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that all jobs are included in the sequence and are in the correct order, ensuring the scheduling algorithm works as expected for ideal conditions.
  This test is significant as it validates the method's ability to produce a correct job sequence when no jobs conflict with each other's deadlines.
Scenario 2: Job sequence with some jobs missing due to deadline constraints
Details:
  TestName: jobSequenceWithSomeJobsMissingDueToDeadlines
  Description: This test checks if the method correctly excludes jobs that cannot be scheduled within their deadlines.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an ArrayList of jobs with some jobs having the same deadline, which exceeds the number of slots available.
  Act: Invoke the findJobSequence method with the created list of jobs and size.
  Assert: Check if the result is a string that represents the correct sequence of job IDs, excluding the IDs of jobs that couldn't be scheduled.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that only jobs that can be scheduled within their deadlines appear in the sequence, and in the correct order.
  This test is significant as it tests the method's ability to handle job conflicts and only schedule jobs that fit within their deadlines.
Scenario 3: Empty job list provided
Details:
  TestName: jobSequenceWithEmptyJobList
  Description: This test checks if the method handles an empty list of jobs gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty ArrayList of jobs.
  Act: Invoke the findJobSequence method with the empty list and any size.
  Assert: Check if the result is a string that indicates an empty job sequence ("Job Sequence: ").
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the method can handle an empty input without throwing an error and returns an appropriate empty sequence indicator.
  This test is significant as it ensures the method's robustness and error handling when faced with edge case inputs.
Scenario 4: Job sequence with a single job
Details:
  TestName: jobSequenceWithSingleJob
  Description: This test checks if the method can handle a list containing only one job.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an ArrayList of jobs with only one job with a deadline within the size limit.
  Act: Invoke the findJobSequence method with the single-job list and appropriate size.
  Assert: Check if the result is a string that correctly represents the sequence containing only that one job's ID.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method can handle a trivial case of a single job and correctly schedules it.
  This test is significant as it validates the method's behavior in minimalistic scenarios and ensures it does not break with a single element.
Scenario 5: Job sequence with jobs exceeding the deadline limit
Details:
  TestName: jobSequenceWithJobsExceedingDeadlineLimit
  Description: This test checks if the method excludes jobs that have deadlines beyond the provided size limit.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an ArrayList of jobs where at least one job has a deadline greater than the size.
  Act: Invoke the findJobSequence method with the list of jobs and size.
  Assert: Check if the result is a string that correctly represents the sequence without including the job that exceeds the deadline limit.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the method ignores jobs that cannot be scheduled because their deadlines are beyond the available slots.
  This test is significant as it checks the method's ability to filter out unschedulable jobs based on deadline constraints.
Scenario 6: Job list with null values
Details:
  TestName: jobSequenceWithNullValuesInList
  Description: This test checks if the method can handle a list containing null values without throwing an exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an ArrayList of jobs with some valid jobs and some null values.
  Act: Invoke the findJobSequence method with the list containing nulls and a size that accommodates the non-null jobs.
  Assert: Check if the result is a string that correctly represents the sequence of non-null jobs only.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method can ignore null values in the input list and only schedules valid jobs.
  This test is significant as it ensures that the method can handle faulty input gracefully and does not fail when encountering null elements.
