```
Scenario 1: All items can be included in the knapsack
Details:
  TestName: allItemsFitKnapsack
  Description: This test checks if the method correctly calculates the total value when all items can fit into the knapsack without exceeding the capacity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define arrays for weights and values, and set the knapsack capacity such that all items can be included.
  Act: Call fractionalKnapsack with the defined arrays and capacity.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value equals the sum of all item values.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that when the knapsack can hold all items, the method returns the maximum possible value, which is the sum of all item values. This test is significant as it checks the basic functionality where no fractional items are considered.
Scenario 2: No items fit in the knapsack
Details:
  TestName: noItemsFitKnapsack
  Description: This test checks if the method returns a value of 0 when the knapsack capacity is too small to include any items.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define arrays for weights and values, and set the knapsack capacity to 0.
  Act: Call fractionalKnapsack with the defined arrays and capacity.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value equals 0.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that with a capacity of 0, no items can be added to the knapsack, and thus the total value should also be 0. This test is significant as it checks the edge case of an unusable knapsack.
Scenario 3: Only fractional part of one item fits in the knapsack
Details:
  TestName: singleFractionalItemFitsKnapsack
  Description: This test checks if the method correctly calculates the value when only a fractional part of one item can fit into the knapsack.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define arrays for weights and values, and set the knapsack capacity to a value less than the smallest item weight.
  Act: Call fractionalKnapsack with the defined arrays and capacity.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value equals the fractional value of the item that can partially fit.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly calculates the value when only a fraction of an item can be included, based on its value-to-weight ratio. This test is significant as it checks the fractional part inclusion logic, which is a key aspect of the fractional knapsack problem.
Scenario 4: Items with the same value-to-weight ratio
Details:
  TestName: itemsWithEqualValueToWeightRatio
  Description: This test checks if the method correctly handles multiple items with the same value-to-weight ratio.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define arrays for weights and values where multiple items have the same value-to-weight ratio, and set an appropriate knapsack capacity.
  Act: Call fractionalKnapsack with the defined arrays and capacity.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is correct based on the sorted order of items with equal value-to-weight ratio.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method handles items with the same ratio correctly, ensuring that the order of items does not affect the final value. This test is significant as it checks the stability of the sorting algorithm in cases of equal ratios.
Scenario 5: Large number of items
Details:
  TestName: largeNumberOfItems
  Description: This test checks if the method can handle a large number of items without performance degradation or errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define large arrays for weights and values, and set an appropriate knapsack capacity.
  Act: Call fractionalKnapsack with the defined arrays and capacity.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is correct and that the method completes within a reasonable time frame.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the algorithm scales well with the number of items and that the correct value is returned even for a large dataset. This test is significant for assessing the performance and scalability of the implementation.
