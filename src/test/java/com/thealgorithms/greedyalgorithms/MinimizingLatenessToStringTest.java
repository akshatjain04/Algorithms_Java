ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=toString_bbffdadaa2
Scenario 1: Testing toString with all default values
Details:
  TestName: toStringWithDefaultValues
  Description: This test checks the toString method when all class fields are set to their default values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with default field values.
  Act: Call the toString method on the instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned string matches the expected default format.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the toString method correctly formats the string with default values for jobName, startTime, lateness, and processingTime (implicitly 0 since it is null). This test is significant as it checks the behavior of the method without any modifications to the default state of the object.
Scenario 2: Testing toString with a custom job name and default times
Details:
  TestName: toStringWithCustomJobName
  Description: This test verifies the toString method with a non-null jobName and default timing values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a specific jobName and default timing values.
  Act: Call the toString method on the instance.
  Assert: Check that the returned string includes the custom jobName and default timing values.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the toString method incorporates the custom jobName into the output string while keeping the default timing values intact. This test is important to ensure that the jobName is correctly reflected in the toString output.
Scenario 3: Testing toString with negative timing values
Details:
  TestName: toStringWithNegativeTimingValues
  Description: This test checks how the toString method handles negative values for startTime and lateness.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with negative values for startTime and lateness.
  Act: Call the toString method on the instance.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned string accurately represents negative timing values.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the toString method can handle negative numbers and correctly format them into the output string. This test is crucial for validating the robustness of the method against atypical data.
Scenario 4: Testing toString with maximum integer values
Details:
  TestName: toStringWithMaxIntValues
  Description: This test checks the toString method's behavior when the timing values are set to Integer.MAX_VALUE.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with Integer.MAX_VALUE for startTime and lateness.
  Act: Call the toString method on the instance.
  Assert: Ensure that the returned string correctly displays the maximum integer values without overflow.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the toString method can handle the maximum integer values and produce a correct string representation without integer overflow. This test is important to confirm that the method works with boundary integer values.
Scenario 5: Testing toString with processingTime and deadline set
Details:
  TestName: toStringWithProcessingTimeAndDeadline
  Description: This test checks the toString method when processingTime and deadline are set, impacting the endTime and lateness calculations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with specific values for startTime, processingTime, and deadline.
  Act: Call the toString method on the instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned string reflects the correct endTime and calculates lateness based on the deadline.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the toString method accurately calculates and includes the endTime in the output string and computes lateness based on the deadline. This test is significant to validate that the method's logic correctly handles the interdependencies between fields.
Scenario 6: Testing toString with null jobName
Details:
  TestName: toStringWithNullJobName
  Description: This test verifies the toString method's output when the jobName is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a null jobName and valid timing values.
  Act: Call the toString method on the instance.
  Assert: Check that the returned string represents a null jobName appropriately.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the toString method can handle a null jobName and still produce a valid string without throwing an exception. This test is important for confirming the method's null-safety for the jobName field.
