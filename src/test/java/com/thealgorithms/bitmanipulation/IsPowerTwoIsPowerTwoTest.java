"Scenario 1: Test for Input as 1
Details:
  TestName: testInputAsOne.
  Description: This test checks the software's response when the input is 1, a valid power of two.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Not needed as our function doesn't require any setup.
    Act: Call isPowerTwo with parameter 1.
    Assert: The return value must be true as 1 is a power of 2 (2^0).
  Validation:
    This function must return true for 1 as 1 is the 0th power of 2. Hence, in binary, only the least significant bit is 1, fulfilling the criteria of the function.


Scenario 2: Testing for large power of 2
Details:
  TestName: testLargePowerOfTwo.
  Description: This test is meant to observe the program's behaviour with large powers of two.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Not required as our function does not require prior setup.
    Act: Invoke isPowerTwo with a large power of 2 like 2^30
    Assert: Check whether the return value is true.
  Validation:
    This function must return true for any positive power of 2. Here we check whether the function is capable of handling large numbers and still performs correctly.


Scenario 3: Testing for non-power of two numbers
Details:
  TestName: testNonPowerOfTwo.
  Description: This test aims to confirm the software correctly identifies non-power of two numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Not needed as our function doesn't require any setup.
    Act: Call isPowerTwo with a non-power of 2 number like 21.
    Assert: Check if the return value is false.
  Validation:
    This function must return false for a number which isn't a power of 2. This test just verifies this particular negative scenario.

Scenario 4: Testing for Negative Inputs
Details:
  TestName: testNegativeInputs.
  Description: This test focuses on checking the function's behaviour with negative inputs.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Not needed as our function doesn't require any setup.
    Act: Call isPowerTwo with a negative integer.
    Assert: The return value should be false, as negative numbers cannot be powers of 2.
  Validation:
    This function must return false for any negative number, as they are never a power of 2. This test ensures our function is non-crashing and behaves correctly for negative numbers.

Scenario 5: Validating for Zero input
Details:
  TestName: testInputAsZero.
  Description: This test case checks for input as zero. The function should identify that zero is not a power of two.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Not required as our function doesn't require any setup.
    Act: Call isPowerTwo with parameter 0.
    Assert: Check the function's return status, it should be false.
  Validation:
    This test case ensures the function is not considering zero as a power of two, therefore, it must return False as 0 isn't a power of two.
