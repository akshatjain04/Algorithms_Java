"Scenario 1: Testing the functionality of the setBit method with a negative number as input parameter
Details:
    TestName: negativeNumberSetBitTest
    Description: This test checks the functionality of the setBit method when it is invoked with a negative number
    Execution:
    Arrange: No setup necessary as input parameters are direct to the method.
    Act: Invoke SingleBitOperations.setBit method with -5 and any bit index as parameters.
    Assert: Compare the returned value against the expected result.
    Validation:
    This assertion checks the ability of the setBit method to handle negative numbers correctly. It verifies if our implementation will handle negative numbers and still set the bit correctly.

Scenario 2: Testing the handling of the setBit method with the bit position larger than the size of the integer
Details:
    TestName: overSizedBitPositionSetBitTest
    Description: This test validates how the setBit method handles when the bit position is larger than the size of the integer.
    Execution:
    Arrange: No setup necessary as input parameters are direct to the method.
    Act: Invoke the SingleBitOperations.setBit method with any number and a bit size larger than the size of integer (say 35) as parameters.
    Assert: Validate if the returned value behaves as expected when an oversized bit position is given.
    Validation:
    This verifies the setBit function's robustness and error handling capabilities. Checking whether our application provides continual unbreaking service even in the face of erroneous user input.

Scenario 3: Verifying the setBit method with zero as the input parameter.
Details:
    TestName: zeroNumberSetBitTest
    Description: This test validates the setBit method by passing in zero as the 'num' parameter.
    Execution:
    Arrange: No setup necessary as input parameters are direct to the method.
    Act: Invoke the SingleBitOperations.setBit method with 0 as 'num' and any bit position as parameters.
    Assert: Compare the returned value against the expected result.
    Validation:
    This test ensures that the setBit method can correctly handle the situation when zero is given as input. It is important to cover all possible edge cases to ensure the robustness of the application.

Scenario 4: Testing the setBit functionality with the 'bit' value as zero.
Details:
    TestName: zeroBitValueSetBitTest
    Description: This test scenario is written to check how the setBit method behaves when the 'bit' parameter is set to zero.
    Execution:
    Arrange: No setup necessary as input parameters are direct to the method.
    Act: Invoke the SingleBitOperations.setBit method with any positive number as 'num' and 0 as 'bit' parameter.
    Assert: Assert to check if the returned value is as expected when the 'bit' value is zero.
    Validation:
    This assertion ensures the setBit method can correctly handle the zero 'bit' cases and verifies whether the implementation considers the least significant bit while setting the bit.
