  Scenario 1: Testing an even positive number

  Details:
    TestName: testIsEvenWithEvenPositiveNumber
    Description: This test is meant to check if the isEven method correctly identifies an even positive number.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No specific data arrangement is necessary for this test.
    Act: Invoke the isEven method with an even positive number (for example, 4).
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the return value is true.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the isEven method correctly identifies even positive numbers. The expected result is true since 4 is an even number. This is significant in ensuring the accuracy of the isEven method.

  Scenario 2: Testing an even negative number

  Details:
    TestName: testIsEvenWithEvenNegativeNumber
    Description: This test is meant to verify that the isEven method correctly identifies an even negative number.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No specific data arrangement is necessary for this test.
    Act: Invoke the isEven method with an even negative number (for example, -10).
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the return value is true.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to confirm that the isEven method can correctly identify even negative numbers. The expected result is true since -10 is an even number. This is key in ensuring the accuracy of the isEven method.

  Scenario 3: Testing odd positive number

  Details:
    TestName: testIsEvenWithOddPositiveNumber
    Description: This test is meant to verify that the isEven method correctly identifies an odd positive number.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No specific data arrangement is necessary for this test.
    Act: Invoke the isEven method with an odd positive number (for example, 13).
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the return value is false.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to confirm that the isEven method correctly identifies odd positive numbers. The expected result is false since 13 is an odd number. This verifies the accuracy of the isEven method.

  Scenario 4: Testing odd negative number

  Details:
    TestName: testIsEvenWithOddNegativeNumber
    Description: This test is meant to verify that the isEven method correctly identifies an odd negative number.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No specific data arrangement is necessary for this test.
    Act: Invoke the isEven method with an odd negative number (for example, -7).
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the return value is false.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to confirm that the isEven method correctly identifies odd negative numbers. The expected result is false since -7 is an odd number. This verifies the accuracy of the isEven method.
