"""
  Scenario 1: Validate paths when the source and destination are different nodes
  Details:  
    TestName: validatePathsForDifferentNodes.
    Description: This test will check if application correctly identifies, stores and returns all possible paths from source to destination when both are different nodes.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Setup the graph and add the edges. Create two variables namely source and destination and assign different nodes to them respectively.
    Act: Call the method allPathsFromSourceToTarget with the source, destination and graph details.
    Assert: Verify that the returned paths are valid and contain exact the nodes from source to destination.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the function correctly traces the paths from the source to destination. This is significant as it validates the core functionality of the application - traversing paths in a graph.

  Scenario 2: Validate paths when the source is also the destination
  Details:  
    TestName: validatePathsWhenSourceIsDestination.
    Description: This test checks whether the application can correctly handle the scenario where source and destination are the same node.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Setup the graph and the edges. Create a source variable and assign a node to it. Make the destination the same as source.
    Act: Call the method allPathsFromSourceToTarget with the source, destination and graph details.
    Assert: Verify that the returned path contains only the source (which is also the destination).
  Validation: 
    The assertion checks if the function can handle the edge case where source and destination are the same. This is relevant as it checks the resilience of the application in handling rare but possible scenarios.

  Scenario 3: Validate paths when there's no path from source to destination
  Details:  
    TestName: validatePathsWhenNoPathExist.
    Description: This test verifies whether the function can correctly handle the scenario where there's no path exists from source to destination.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Setup the graph and the edges such that no path exists between a specific source and destination.
    Act: Call the method allPathsFromSourceToTarget with that source, destination and graph details.
    Assert: Verify that the returned value is an empty list.
  Validation: 
    This assertion validates that the function correctly handles situations where there's no path from source to destination. This is significant as it proves the robustness of the application in dealing with possible real-world scenarios. 

  Scenario 4: Test when graph contains cycle
  Details:  
    TestName: validatePathsWhenGraphContainsCycle.
    Description: This test verifies that the function can correctly handle the scenario where the graph contains a cycle.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Setup the graph and the edges such that a cycle is formed between nodes.
    Act: Call the method allPathsFromSourceToTarget with a source, destination and graph details.
    Assert: Verify that the returned paths are correct and do not contain any loop (which would be the case if the cycle was not handled correctly).
  Validation: 
    This assertion ensures that function can handle scenarios where the graph contains cycles. This is important to prevent infinite loops in the graph traversal.
