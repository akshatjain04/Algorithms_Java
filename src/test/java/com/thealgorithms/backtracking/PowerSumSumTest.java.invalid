""" 
Scenario 1: Testing the sum function for normal inputs

Details:  
  TestName: testSumForNormalInputs
  Description: This test is designed to check the sum function when it given inputs within normal parameters (integers greater than 0). This test is crucial for ensuring the function operates as expected under regular usage. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the PowerSum class. Manually compute the expected result by increasing counter for each possible combination whose sum equals to given number n.
  Act: Call the sum method with the inputs n, x, and i.
  Assert: Use the JUnit assertEquals method to compare the actual result with the expected result.
Validation: 
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. The result should match the expected as increased counter indicates number of possible combinations that gives sum equal to given number n. Test the functionality, ensuring it returns expected values when given normal parameters.

Scenario 2: Testing the sum method with zero as an input

Details:  
  TestName: testSumWithZeroInput
  Description: This test is designed to check the sum function when it is given zero as one of the inputs. The sum of any number raised to zero is always one.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the PowerSum class. The expected result is one, as sum of any number power of 0 is 1.
  Act: Call the sum method with zero as one of the inputs.
  Assert: Use the JUnit assertEquals method to compare the actual result with the expected result.
Validation: 
  Since the sum of any number to the power of zero is one, the result of the function should be one or the count should be increased one time, verifying the correct response to a zero input.


Scenario 3: Testing the sum function for negative inputs

Details:
  TestName: testSumForNegativeInputs
  Description: This test is designed to check the sum function when it is given negative numbers as inputs. Real numbers have meaningful power operation for negative numbers but in this case, the scenario assumes natural numbers or whole numbers computation. Therefore, the expected outcome is not defined.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of PowerSum class. There is no expected result in this case, as negative inputs are not defined in this context.
  Act: Call the sum method with negative numbers as inputs.
  Assert: Use JUnit to assert that an Exception should be thrown.
Validation:
  This aims to verify that the function handles the corner case of negative inputs correctly by returning an Exception, which indicates that the inputs are outside of the expected and allowable range.
  
Scenario 4: Testing the sum function with large input values

Details:  
  TestName: testSumWithLargeInputs
  Description: This test is designed to check the sum function when it is given large numbers as inputs. The behavior of the function when dealing with big inputs is valuable in terms of system limits.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the PowerSum class. In general, large numbers generate big computational sums and it depends on the number combinations that will sum up to given number n.
  Act: Call the sum method with large numbers as inputs.
  Assert: There are no predetermined outcomes, but this test is used to detect any system crashes or indications of poor performance.
Validation: 
  Verify the function's response to large inputs, testing for performance issues or vulnerabilities.
