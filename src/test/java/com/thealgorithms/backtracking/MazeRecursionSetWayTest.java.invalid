"""" 
Scenario 1: Test for path finding from upper left corner to bottom right corner of the maze

Details:  
  TestName: testPathFindingInMaze.
  Description: In an open maze free of obstacles, this test aims to verify that the setWay method can successfully guide the ball from the top left corner to the bottom right corner using its directional strategy. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a 2D array representing a clear maze, where the ball begins at (1,1) and ends at (6,5). Mark all the walls and the goal destination. 
  Act: Invoke the setWay method with the prepared maze and the ball's starting point. 
  Assert: Assert that the setWay method returns 'true', indicating a successful pathfinding.
Validation: 
  The assertion asserts that a clear path is found in a clear maze. It verifies the basic functionality of the setWay method.

Scenario 2: Test for path finding in a blocked maze split by a horizontal wall

Details:  
  TestName: testPathBlockedByHorizontalWall.
  Description: In a maze split by a horizontal wall, this test aims to verify that setWay method would return false, since ball cannot find a path from starting point to goal. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Construct a 2D array configuring a maze where the path from the ball's initial coordinate to the end is blocked by a horizontal wall. Set the ball's beginning position.
  Act: Invoke the setWay method with the generated maze and the ball's starting position.
  Assert: Assert that setWay method returns 'false'.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that when there is no feasible path to the goal, the setWay method correctly returns 'false'. This verifies the method's effectiveness in solving complex maze scenarios.

Scenario 3: Test for path finding in a maze with a single solution

Details:  
  TestName: testPathFindingInSingleSolutionMaze.
  Description: This test aims to check that the setWay function can accurately navigate through a complex maze with a single clear path to the goal. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Construct a 2D array representing a maze where only one feasible route exists to the goal from the ball's starting coordinate. Provide the ball's initial coordinates.
  Act: Execute the setWay method providing the generated maze and the ball's starting position.
  Assert: Assert that setWay returns 'true'.
Validation: 
  This asserts that a feasible path is found by the setWay method in a complex maze with a single viable solution. It tests the method's algorithm's effectiveness in maze solving.

Scenario 4: Test for path finding in maze with multiple solutions

Details:  
  TestName: testPathFindingInMultiSolutionMaze.
  Description: This test aims to verify that the setWay method can successfully find a path in a complex maze with multiple solutions. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Construct a 2D array representing a maze where multiple paths exist from the initial coordinate to the goal. Set the ball's starting point. 
  Act: Invoke the setWay method providing the constructed maze and the ball's starting point.
  Assert: Assert that setWay method returns 'true'.
Validation: 
  The assertion demonstrates that despite multiple paths existing, the setWay method is able to find a feasible path to the goal, testing the algorithm's flexibility.
  
Scenario 5: Test for path finding when starting point and goal are located at same position

Details:  
  TestName: testPathFindingWhenStartAndGoalAreSame.
  Description: This test aims to verify that the setWay method can handle a case where the ball's starting point is the goal itself. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Construct a 2D array representing a maze where the starting position of the ball (1,1) is at the same coordinate as the goal (1,1). Set the ball's starting point.
  Act: Invoke the setWay method with the maze and the ball's starting point. 
  Assert: Assert that setWay method returns 'true'.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method can handle edge cases where the ball's starting position is the same as the goal, and correctly returns 'true'.
