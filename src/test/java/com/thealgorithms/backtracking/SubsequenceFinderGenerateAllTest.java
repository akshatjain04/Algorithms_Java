  Scenario 1: Testing with Empty List Input

  Details:
    TestName: testGenerateAllWithEmptyInput
    Description: This test is designed to verify the functionality of the generateAll method when an empty list is passed as the input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: An initial ArrayList of type <T> is created and kept empty.
    Act: The generateAll method of the SubsequenceFinder is called with this empty ArrayList as argument.
    Assert: The result is checked against an ArrayList which only contains an Empty ArrayList.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that when an empty list is used as the sequence, a list containing an empty list alone should be returned. It is expected behaviour, as an empty list has only one subsequence, the empty list itself.

  Scenario 2: Testing with a Single Element List

  Details:
    TestName: testGenerateAllWithSingleElement
    Description: This test intends to check the output of generateAll method when a single element list is given as the input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: An initial ArrayList of type <T> containing a single element is created.
    Act: The generateAll method of the SubsequenceFinder is called with this single element ArrayList as argument.
    Assert: The result is checked against an ArrayList which contains two ArrayLists - an empty ArrayList and an ArrayList with the single element.
  Validation:
    The assertion validates that the generateAll method correctly generates all subsequences for a sequence with single element; including the empty subsequence and the single element subsequence.

  Scenario 3: Testing with a List of Multiple Distinct Elements

  Details:
    TestName: testGenerateAllWithMultipleDistinctElements
    Description: This test intends to verify the functionality of the generateAll method when a multiple distinct elements list is given as the input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: An initial ArrayList of type <T> containing distinct elements is created.
    Act: The generateAll method of the SubsequenceFinder is called with this ArrayList as argument.
    Assert: The result is checked against an ArrayList containing all the combinations of the distinct elements.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks that the generateAll method correctly generates all subsequences for a sequence with multiple distinct elements.

  Scenario 4: Testing with a List of Multiple Identical Elements

  Details:
    TestName: testGenerateAllWithMultipleIdenticalElements
    Description: This scenario verifies the functionality of the generateAll method when a multiple identical elements list is given as the input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: An initial ArrayList of type <T> containing identical elements is created.
    Act: The generateAll method of the SubsequenceFinder is called with this ArrayList as argument.
    Assert: The result is checked against an ArrayList containing all the combinations of the identical elements.
  Validation:
    The assertion validates the fact that the generateAll method can correctly generate all subsequences for a sequence with multiple identical elements.

  Scenario 5: Testing with a Null List

  Details:
    TestName: testGenerateAllWithNullInput
    Description: This test is designed to verify how the generateAll method behaves when null is given as the input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement needed as the input is null.
    Act: The generateAll method of the SubsequenceFinder is called with null as argument.
    Assert: Expect NullPointerException.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies if the method is capable of handling null input and if it throws an appropriate exception.
