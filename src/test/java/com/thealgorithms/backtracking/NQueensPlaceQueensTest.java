"""
Scenario 1: Testing NQueens with only one queen
Details:
  TestName: testSingleQueenPlace
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the placeQueens method works correctly when there's only one queen to place.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific mock or data needs to be prepared since we input the value as a direct argument.
  Act: Call the method placeQueens with 1 as argument.
  Assert: We can't directly access return data or results as method is void, but we can verify the console prints by redirecting system out and comparing output with expected.
Validation:
  We should check that the output shows a single "Q" as a 1x1 size board only allows one queen and that's the only possible arrangement.

Scenario 2: Testing NQueens with a two queen
Details:
  TestName: testTwoQueensPlaces
  Description: This test is intended to verify how the placeQueens method handles the scenario where two queens can't be placed in a way where they are attacking each other ( as they are in a 2x2 board).
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific mock or data needs to be prepared since we input the value as a direct argument.
  Act: Call the method placeQueens with 2 as argument.
  Assert: We can't directly access return data or results as method is void, but we can verify the console prints by redirecting system out and comparing output with expected.
Validation:
  The output should reveal that no possible arrangements exist. Thus, it should print "There is no way to place 2 queens on board of size 2x2".

Scenario 3: Testing NQueens with valid solution
Details:
  TestName: testFourQueensPlaces
  Description: This test is to verify a scenario where there is a valid and correct way to place queens.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific mock or data needs to be prepared since we input the value as a direct argument.
  Act: Call the method placeQueens with 4 as argument.
  Assert: Once again, we can't directly assert due to method being void so we compare console output with expected.
Validation:
  The outputs should correspond to the valid solutions for placing 4 queens on a 4x4 board. The program should correctly calculate and print these solutions.

Scenario 4: Testing Edge case: negative queen count
Details:
  TestName: testNegativeQueenCount
  Description: Testing placeQueens method with negative number as argument.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific mock or data needs to be prepared since we input the value as a direct argument.
  Act: Call the placeQueens with a negative number as the argument.
  Assert: Due to method being void, we can't assert the result directly. But we can check the console output to ensure it's as expected.
Validation:
  Validation rules depend on the methods implementation for negative numbers. Ideally it should throw an IllegalArgumentException or some similar exception to indicate invalid input.
