  Scenario 1: Valid edge addition to the graph

  Details:
    TestName: addValidEdge
    Description: This test is meant to check the successful addition of a valid edge to the graph from a given source 'u' to a destination 'v'. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialise the graph with valid vertices.
    Act: Invoke addEdge method with valid integer parameters representing source 'u' and destination 'v'.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the edge has been successfully added in the adjacency list of the source vertex.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the edge from 'u' to 'v' has been successfully added in the adjacency list of 'u'. If the edge is added correctly, the behavior of the application graph traversal functions will be as expected.

  Scenario 2: Invalid edge addition to the graph

  Details:  
    TestName: addInvalidEdge
    Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the system when trying to add an invalid edge (i.e., either the source or the destination or both are out of range).
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialise the graph with a certain number of vertices.
    Act: Invoke addEdge method with integer parameters representing 'u' and 'v' which are out of range in the adjacency list array.
    Assert: Expect an exception, probably ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException or a custom exception, if implemented in your code.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify the exception is thrown as expected. This test is significant as this validates the error handling and boundary conditions of the graph.

  Scenario 3: Add edge to an uninitialised vertex
  Details:  
    TestName: addEdgeToUninitialisedVertex
    Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the system when trying to add an edge to an uninitialised vertex in the graph.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Do not to initialise the adjacency list of vertex 'u'.
    Act: Invoke addEdge method with 'u' and 'v' as integer parameters.
    Assert: Expect a NullPointerException.
  Validation: 
    The assertion ensures the application throws a NullPointerException when trying to add an edge to an uninitialised vertex. This test case is important to validate the error handling mechanism in the code.
