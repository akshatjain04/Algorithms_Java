  Scenario 1: Testing with Negative Power

  Details:  
    TestName: testNegativePower.
    Description: This test verifies a scenario in which an exception is thrown when a negative power value is passed to the powSum method.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the PowerSum object.
    Act: Invoke the powSum method with valid number and negative power value.
    Assert: Expect an IllegalArgumentException.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to ensure that the powSum method handles negative power values correctly. The method should throw an IllegalArgumentException in these cases, preventing invalid power usage.

""" 

"""
  Scenario 2: Testing with LARGE Number and SMALL Power

  Details:  
    TestName: testLargeNumberSmallPower.
    Description: This test checks the performance of the powSum method when a large number and a small power value are used.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the PowerSum object.
    Act: Invoke the powSum method with a large number and a small power.
    Assert: Expect the result to be correct and return within appropriate time.
  Validation: 
    The assertion ensures that the powSum method can handle large numbers and small powers efficiently and swiftly. This test scenario is significant for verifying the method's performance with large input values.
"""

"""
  Scenario 3: Testing with SMALL Number and LARGE Power

  Details:  
    TestName: testSmallNumberLargePower.
    Description: This test checks the performance of the powSum method when a small number and a large power value are used.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the PowerSum object.
    Act: Invoke the powSum method with small number and large power.
    Assert: Expect the result to be correct and return within appropriate time.
  Validation: 
    The assertion ensures that the powSum method can handle small numbers and large powers efficiently and swiftly. This test scenario is significant for verifying the method's performance with large power values.
"""

"""
  Scenario 4: Testing with VERY LARGE Number and LARGE Power

  Details:  
    TestName: testVeryLargeNumberAndLargePower.
    Description: This test aims to evaluate the scenario where the powSum method is invoked with a very large number and a large power value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the PowerSum object.
    Act: Invoke the powSum method with a very large number and a large power.
    Assert: Expect an ArithmeticException due to integer overflow.
  Validation: 
    The assertion ensures that the powSum method handles integer overflows correctly by throwing an ArithmeticException. This test scenario is critical in identifying instances where integer overflows could occur due to large input values.
