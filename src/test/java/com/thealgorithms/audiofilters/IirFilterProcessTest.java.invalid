Scenario 1: Test Process Functionality With Zero Input Sample

Details:
  TestName: testProcessWithZeroInputSample
  Description: Test to check the process method when the input sample is 0.0. It will validate the functionality of the process functionality with the base case.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set required 'aCoeffs', 'bCoeffs', and 'sample'=0.0 using setCoeffs() and process() methods respectively.
  Act: Invoke the process() method with zero as input parameter.
  Assert: Assert the expected outcomes with the value returned by process(). 
Validation:
  The test ensures that process() works as expected with a zero input sample by comparing the actual output with the expected output. Any deviation will lead to test failure indicating an issue with the process() method.   

Scenario 2: Test Process Functionality with Non-Zero Input Sample

Details:
  TestName: testProcessWithNonZeroInputSample
  Description: Test to check the process method when the input sample is a non-zero number to validate the functionality under normal circumstances.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set required 'aCoeffs', 'bCoeffs', and 'sample' with a non-zero value using setCoeffs() and process() methods respectively.
  Act: Invoke the process() method with a non-zero input parameter.
  Assert: Assert the expected outcomes with the value returned by process().
Validation:
  The test ensures that process() works as expected with non-zero input sample by comparing the actual output with the expected output. Any deviation will lead to test failure indicating an issue with the process() method.   

Scenario 3: Negative Test for Exceptional Conditions in process() Method

Details:
  TestName: testProcessForExceptionalConditions
  Description: Test to check the process method when 'aCoeffs[0]' is zero as it will lead to a division by zero scenario.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set 'aCoeffs[0]=0.0', 'bCoeffs' and 'sample' using setCoeffs() and process() methods respectively.
  Act: Invoke the process() method.
  Assert: Expect a ArithmeticException and catch this exception in the test.
Validation:
  This test validates that an ArithmeticException is thrown when 'aCoeffs[0]' is zero, thus verifying the error handling in the 'process()' method for exceptional conditions. 

Scenario 4: Test Process Functionality with Large Double Input Sample

Details:
  TestName: testProcessWithLargeDoubleInputSample
  Description: Test to check the process method when the input sample is a large double number to validate the functionality under boundary conditions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set required 'aCoeffs', 'bCoeffs', and 'sample' with a large double value using setCoeffs() and process() methods respectively.
  Act: Invoke the process() method with a large double input parameter.
  Assert: Assert the expected outcomes with the value returned by process().
Validation:
  The test ensures that process() works as expected with large double input sample by comparing the actual output with the expected output. Any deviation will lead to test failure indicating an issue with process() method.
